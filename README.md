## Description
This project is to replicate the jellybean-like creature in Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout. 

The body is made of a substraction between a normally placed cylinder and a Horizontally placed cylinder. The actual face is made of a
thin cylinder. The two pupils are also made of cylinders. The arms and fingers are cones and round cones blended together. 

As for the animation, I used sin function to make him blink over time. I also added a bias function onto the sin function to make the blink faster. 

I also implemented soft shadows and various material in lambert and Blinn-Phong shading.
